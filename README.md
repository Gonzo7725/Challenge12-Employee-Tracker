# Challenge12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This week we were challenged to create an application that allows the user to access their employees database and browse through the data while having functionality through the terminal, to add and update the employee database. Using Node.js and MySQL, users can securely access all employee's data with some command-line functionality.

## Installation 

-npm install node package manager
-install inquirer
-install MySQL2
-install console.table
-enter mysql password to login
-download database and tables to your remote workspace
