# Challenge12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This week we were challenged to create an application that allows the user to access their employees database and browse through the data while having functionality through the terminal, to add and update the employee database. Using Node.js and MySQL, users can securely access all employee's data with some command-line functionality.

## Installation 

-npm install node package manager
-install inquirer
-install MySQL2
-install console.table
-enter mysql password to login
-download database and tables to your remote workspace 

## Usage

After installation instructions, go to the terminal and begin the program using the command 'npm start' or 'node index.js.'

From the main menu you can choose from one of these selections

-View all departments
-View all roles
-View all employees by manager
-View all employees by department
-View utilized budget by department
-Add a department
-Add a role
-Add an employee
-Update an employee role
-Delete a department
-Delete a role
-Delete an employee
-View total utilized budget of a department

Follow the prompts to add, update, or remove if chosen or simply select from the view list to access your tables. Once completed, you will be brought back to the main menu. To finish your session, simply close the terminal.
